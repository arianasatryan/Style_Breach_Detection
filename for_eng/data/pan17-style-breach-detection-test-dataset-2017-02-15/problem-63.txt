These drives come with 3D DriveGuard, an invention of HP's. It's an active-protection system with an accelerometer to sense if the machine is falling or has been jolted. This sends a signal to the drive to park the heads to prevent damage under impact. A very useful feature indeed for such a portable machine. The Mini has an aluminium casing making it more durable and scratch resistant than many other netbooks that come with a plastic casing. Durability is much needed in a small machine that you're likely to take out and about with you and use in public places. Under benchmark testing, the Mini 2140 scores similarly to other comparitative machines on the market. The standard three cell battery runs for around 2 hours fifteen minutes on a full charge which isn't great.

However the six cell option runs for twice as long.

The Hewlet Packard Mini 2140 is a good overall machine, popular with both home and business users. It is powerful for most every day uses and is very portable due its compact size. The aluminium casing makes it that little bit tougher than most other netbooks too.
