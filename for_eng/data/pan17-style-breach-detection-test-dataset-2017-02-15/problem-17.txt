This is based on the American Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel current policy on fasting blood triglyceride levels in adults: However, it should be noted that the usual quoted "normal" blood lipid levels change depending upon the levels found in the majority of the population and upon what doctors considered is normal. Therefore, declaring "normal" triglyceride levels do NOT necessarily mean you have "healthy" levels. Normal : less than 150 mg/dL (<1.7 mmol/L) Borderline-high : 150 - 199 mg/dL (1.7.3 mmol/L) High : 200 - 499 mg/dL (2.3.64 mmol/L) Very high : higher than 500 mg/dL (>5.64 mmol/L) The Canadian guidelines on fasting blood triglyceride levels in adults: Optimal: less than 2.0 mmol/L (<177.2 mg/dL) Acceptable: 2.0 - 2.5 mmol/L (177.2 - 221.5 mg/dL) Compromised: higher than 2.5 mmol/L (>221.5 mg/dL) Categorization of blood triglyceride levels in adults as per some European guidelines: No risk: less than 1.7 mmol/L (<150.1 mg/dL) Suspect: between 1.7 - 2.3 mmol/L (150.1 - 203.1 mg/dL) Requiring attention and intervention: fasting 1.7 - 2.3 mmol/L (151.1 - 203.1 mg/dL) Requiring aggressive treatment: 2.3 - 4.6 mmol/L (203.1 - 407.1 mg/dL) with high LDL cholesterol (greater than 4.1 mmol/L, or 160 mg/dL) Reference "Normal" blood triglyceride ranges based on age: Age "Normal" Triglyceride Range 10 - 29 years 53 - 104 mg/dL, or 0.6 - 1.2 mmol/L 30 - 39 years 55 - 115 mg/dL, or 0.6 - 1.3 mmol/L 40 - 49 years 66 - 139 mg/dL, or 0.7 - 1.6 mmol/L 50 - 59 75 - 163 mg/dL, or 0.8 - 1.8 mmol/L 60 - 69 78 - 158 mg/dL, or 0.9 - 1.8 mmol/L > 70 years 83 - 141 mg/dL, or 0.94 - 1.6 mmol/L Many health professionals find this category quite accurate based on gender and age. : Adult Males Upper level: 130 mg/dL + age; Maximum: 200 mg/dL, or 2.3 mmol/L Adult Females Lower level: 80 mg/dL + age; Maximum: 165 mg/dL, or 1.9 mmol/L Adult Males and Females Lower level: Your age Adult Males and Females Below 100 mg/dL, or 1.1 mmol/L: Ideal level NOTE: Fasting values should be based on two serial measurements of serum (blood) triglycerides. Serial measurements are important because of intraindividual triglyceride variability which is 5 times that of cholesterol. Triglycerides constantly circulate in all the subtypes of lipoprotein carrier in the blood, ferrying fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E and K to locations where they're needed, aiding in the synthesis of certain hormones protecting cell membranes. Unfortunately, because of the unhealthy eating habits, many people take the word "lipid" as the synonymous of the problems, such as: elevated triglycerides levels fatty foods like butter, meat, cheese, milk high cholesterol levels obesity animal fat from butter, lard/pork, beef saturated fat in cheese, butter, meat, meat products - hamburgers, sausages, full-fat milk and yogurt. Vegetable sources like coconut and palm oil are also sources of saturated fat "trans fat" (the "partially hydrogenated vegetable oil" found in chips and cookies heart disease and stroke Approximately, 50% of the fat from a meal is burned for energy and the remainder is sent to adipose tissue (body fat), where it is stored until it's needed as energy fuel when a person is fasting. A lean adult has 15 kg of triglycerides which represents approximately enough energy to survive for 3 months (one pound of human body fat contains 3,500 calories). The other two main classes of fats - less than 10 percent of the fat are: phospholipids, such as lecithin sterols, such as cholesterol More than 90% of the fat in the food we eat and in the fat folds on our bodies is made up of triglycerides. The fat tissues in which triglycerides are stored serve as fluid cushions around organs-- the kidneys and the abdomen, and provide thermal insulation. In foods, fats provide flavor and palatability. SUMMARY High cholesterol level can increase your chances of having a heart attack. The higher your cholesterol, the greater your chances of developing the risks. In younger people, an elevated total cholesterol level is particularly significant, because usually, the narrowing of the coronary arteries takes many years to develop. Lifestyle changes like changing your diet, losing weight, and exercising may help lower blood cholesterol levels and increase HDL ("good") cholesterol. Consumption of alcohol in moderation can also increase HDL cholesterol levels. The benefits of alcohol consumption must be balanced against the increased risk of alcoholism , high blood pressure , heart problems such as atrial fibrillation and heart failure , and cirrhosis. Moderate alcohol consumption means no more than 2 drinks a day for men or 1 drink per day for women; 1 drink is 12 fl oz (350 mL) of beer, 5 fl oz (150 mL) of wine, or 1.5 fl oz (45 mL) of liquor. Your doctor may change your goals for cholesterol levels if you have other risk factors for coronary artery disease as the following: High blood pressure Smoking Low HDL cholesterol (less than 40 mg/dL) Diabetes Family history of heart disease You are a man and older than 45, or you are a woman and older than 55. Talk with your doctor about other things that raise your risk for heart problems. Talk to your health professional about which cholesterol screening is best for you. Medical experts disagree about routine screening for lipid disorders . National Cholesterol Education Panel (NCEP) guidelines for cholesterol screening U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines for cholesterol screening American College of Physicians (ACP) guidelines for cholesterol screening Cholesterol screening is often available in supermarkets, pharmacies, shopping malls, and other public places. Home cholesterol testing kits also are available. The results of tests done outside a doctor's office or lab may not be accurate. If you have cholesterol screening done outside your doctor's office, talk with your doctor about the accuracy of the results.
