The resort's Nights Without Neon menu includes the following la carte adventures, offered from May 1 through Labor Day. Moonlight Spa . An exclusive al fresco experience offered only seven nights of the month: three nights during the waxing phase of the moon, once during the full moon, and three times during the moons wane. Since mans earliest days, lunar phases have played a role in physical well-being, and The Ritz-Carlton, Lake Las Vegas Spa offers three exclusive bodywork experiences inspired by lunar effect. These special treatments are experienced on the shores of the resorts private lagoon, bathed in moonlight unobstructed by Las Vegas city lights. They are based on the applicable moon phase, inviting individuals and couples alike to connect to the natural rhythms of the moon above. During the waxing phase, gravity feels at its most intense, and deep therapeutic massage is combined with gentle stretching to relax the body and clear the mind. Contemplating personal goals is recommended during the waxing phase. A full moon signifies energy, and Moonlight Spa during this lunar energy period includes an invigorating massage with special attention to the scalp. Guests can take advantage of the intense energy of this phase to manifest their goals. When the moon finally wanes, surrender and calm prevail; the moon is in retreat, and the guest can retreat as well. Light, relaxed, soothing massage is performed at this time, employing delicate aromatherapy blends. Paying special attention to pressure points on the hands and feet will help guests surrender during this time of calm. Moonlight Spa guests will receive a crystal representing the phase of the moon under which they experience their outdoor treatment. The experience is available on specific nights selected from the lunar calendar. Midnight at the Oasis .
