The Council itself is composed of local youth who are elected into office. They focus on municipal issues, just as the official City Council does.

Cass County is located in west central Missouri, where the West Central Chapter is very active. They used the MO Quail Habitat Initiative Program (QHI, a cooperative cost share program between the MDC and QU) to work on 6,350 acres, along with 7,322.8 acres of CRP acres established in native warm season grass seedings. Prior to 2002, Cass County farmland consisted of fescue pastures and crop fields with fescue field borders, brushy draws and fencerows that had grown into mature trees and overgrown fencerows. The amount of landscape now established to quail friendly practices is estimated to have doubled from less than 5 percent to 10 percent. Hands-on projects leading to the population success on improvable agricultural areas included establishing miles of CRP field borders and filter strips, converting undesirable grass fields to native warm season grasses and wildflowers, restoring degraded prairie and creating miles of low-growing woody cover with edge feathering or shrub plantings. Today these areas provide the needed nesting, brooding and escape cover that were lacking in this intensively farmed area. Tom Lampe, a participating landowner stated, "In the 1980s my farm harbored 10 coveys ( covey is considered to be 10 to 12 birds), but then over the years of stagnant habitat management, it declined to just two. Now, since I have begun to work on intensive habitat management and disturbance, I noticed eight coveys this fall". The guidance and leadership of the Missouri Department of Conservation in concert with other state and federal agencies and conservation partners like Quail Unlimited and the NWTF cannot be overstated. Ultimately, the success of the NBCI and other conservation efforts lies in the hands of dedicated landowners with an interest in restoring bobwhite and other wildlife habitat. Quail Unlimited (QU) is a 501organization dedicated to the restoration of habitat for wild quail and upland wildlife. Its almost 300 chapters nationwide raise local project dollars for on-the-ground projects, including private and public land management with banquets, auctions, sporting clay events and more. QU has a highly trained staff of biologists, state and regional directors and dedicated members that work with private landowners and state and federal agencies to restore quail and upland game populations. In the last 5 years, Quail Unlimited chapters and partners invested over $23.3 million dollars in quail and upland game habitat expenditures and improvements.
