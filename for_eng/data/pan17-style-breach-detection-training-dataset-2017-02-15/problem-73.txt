HISTORY In 1980 The Pampered Chef started simple, having Doris' home in Chicago as the office and warehouse. Yet, through that modesty, her sales had grown to 12, with sales over $50,000 (US) by the end of the first full year. Doris Christopher, a home economist and an educator who used and demonstrated functional, high-quality kitchen equipment and tools, founded The Pampered Chef in US. What made her motivated to open this kind of business was that often the tools we buy in local stores were not of the quality we expect from them. Many products were not designed well according to the needs to the consumers, sales staff were often uninformed about the information included with the products, and the products' information itself was inadequate. Home was the natural setting for the The Pampered Chef's "show and tell" method of selling the cooking products. This show let the consumers see how the products worked; let them try those out; and even let them taste the results. This kind of setting of home demonstration also gave Doris a flexible work schedule that made her balance her career and responsibilities to her family. In 1987 The Pampered Chef's sales exceeded the $1 million (US) mark, and currently, the sales are over $700 (US) million in the US alone. The anticipation that this business will grow incredibly over the next several years is high. In September 1999 With Doris' mission of preserving family mealtime, The Pampered Chef launched its business line in the United Kingdom. The consultants and customers across the country in no time embraced the company, its high-quality kitchen tools and equipment, and its provided exquisite service.

DEC 6, 2007 I am just adding the photo of the PIZZA CUTTER that Deafmom forgot to add to her review. I have it for many years & I cut everything from deep dish pizzas to the packaging tape of boxzes UPS delivered. Works great for me & my husband. AUG 11, 2008 Being a working mom, we eat alot of pre-made meals, pizza being one of the childrens' favorites. This cutter works on the first roll, no need to slice over and over again. I have used it a 1000 + time and wash it in the dishwasher. It still looks brand new has never had to be sharpened.
