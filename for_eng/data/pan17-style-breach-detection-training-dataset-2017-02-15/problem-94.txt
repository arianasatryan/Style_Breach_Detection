You'll find flames in a wide range of other motifs along with flowers, often roses, animals, and the mythical Phoenix rising from the flames. Flame designs can be seen everywhere. Once you start looking you'll keep seeing them. In company logos, on t-shirts and caps and even on the packaging of the food and drink you buy in the supermarket. Flame designs are often associated with rock music, so you'll quite often find flame designs for tattoos and painted onto the back of leather jackets. Flickering animated flames can conjure up images of both power and devastation but also of comfort. The homely warm, romantic open fire that keeps us warm in winter. This isn't the aspect of flame design we usually see though, as the iconic flame designs of tattoos and logos are most commonly symbolising power rather than home comforts.
