CURRENT PROJECTS Following Martha's release in March 2005 from prison , she launched a highly publicized comeback, and was once again involved in Martha Stewart Living. Offerings of her company's Martha Stewart Everyday line at Kmart were expanded to include a new line of ready-made home furnishings, and its mass market interior paint line became available at larger Sears stores. However, the most heavily promoted aspect of her comeback was television. Stewart returned to daytime television with The Martha Stewart Show and appeared in an adapted version of The Apprentice called The Apprentice: Martha Stewart. Both shows premiered in September 2005, and both were produced by Mark Burnett. The Martha Stewart Show is currently in its fourth season. Her prime time Apprentice spin-off received poor ratings, which some attribute to popular dislike for the opportunistic tone of the network's massive promotional campaign and to NBC's scheduling the show up against the hit drama Lost.

Thus, The Apprentice: Martha Stewart wasn't renewed for a second season. In October 2005, Stewart also released a new book called The Martha Rules on starting and managing a new business, and a month later her company released Martha Stewart Baking Handbook. In October 2006, Martha Stewart's Homekeeping Handbook, a reference book about looking after your house, was published by Clarkson Potter. She also became a regular contributor of cooking, gardening, and crafts segments on NBC's Today show. Stewart's daily talk show was nominated in six categories for the 33rd Annual Daytime Emmy Awards in 2006 which includes Best Host and Best Show.

The Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia launched a line of houses that carry her name to be built by KB Home initially in Cary, North Carolina and in different other locations nationwide. The first homes, which were inspired by Stewart's homes in New York and Mount Desert Island in Maine, were completed in early 2006. Ultimately, 650 homes are planned with prices from low $200,000 to mid-$400,000s. A line of paper-based crafts for EK Success is also in development.

In September 2007, she launched an upscale line of home wares for Macy's, which set as the largest brand launch in Macy's history. Stewart has said that she has designed more than 2,000 items exclusively for Macy's , appearing in commercials for the line, which includes bath s, bedding,dinnerware s, and cookwares . In addition to television and merchandising, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia launched a 24-hour satellite radio channel with Sirius in November 2005, on which Stewart currently hosts a weekly call-in show. Stewart has also encouraged her viewers to use the Wikipedia on her program during a segment on pomegranates in order for them to learn more about that fruit's symbolism in Jewish tradition. In addition, she has mentioned to make a Martha Stewart online encyclopedia, Marthapedia.com.

Stewart also made a special appearance on the serio-comic series Ugly Betty in the November 16, 2006, episode entitled "Four Thanksgivings and a Funeral", in which she gave her friend Wilhelmina Slater, played by Vanessa Williams, tips on how to prepare a turkey. Justin Suarez, played by Mark Indelicato, is actually a fan of Stewart. In July of 2006, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia announced a multi-year agreement with FLOR, Inc.- the eco-friendly manufacturer of high-style modular floor coverings, to manufacture and market a new line of Martha Stewart-branded carpet tiles. The Martha Stewart Floor Designs by FLOR line debuted in 2007 with its distinctive design and color palette associated with the Martha Stewart brand. The line's price ranges from $12.99 to $16.99 per tile and includes specially-designed rug creations reflecting the Martha Stewart brand.

The Martha Stewart Floor Designs by FLOR products are available through FLOR.com, the FLOR catalog, and through its selected retailers. The agreement with FLOR was part of the Martha Stewart organization's growing home furnishings program that includes a wide range of products from furniture with Bernhardt, wall color with Lowe's, up to floor coverings with FLOR. On September 14, 2007, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia announced that it inked a partnership with E & J Gallo Winery to produce a wine brand with label "Martha Stewart Vintage" (for sale in 6 cities, January, at $15). There were 15,000 cases to be sold 2006 which include Sonoma County Chardonnay, 2005 Sonoma County Cabernet Sauvignon and 2006 Sonoma County Merlot for Atlanta, Boston, Charlotte, N.C., Denver, Phoenix, and Portland, Oregon. Martha Stewart as well signed a contract with Costco Wholesale Corp. offering frozen and fresh food label - Kirkland Signature. In July 2008, Craft items under the names "Martha Stewart Celebrate" and "Martha Stewart Create" , which are the two divisions of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, premiered in Wal-Mart stores.

The deal came about in part because of the closing of more than 600 K-Mart stores in the United States.
