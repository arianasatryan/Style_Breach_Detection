Maybe youve been on the E/C/A stack for a while now. Maybe you drink a lot of coffee in the morning and soda throughout the day. The human body can easily become desensitized to the ingredients in this stack after prolonged use, thus reducing its effectiveness. For some athletes, the problem may even transcend thermogenesis. Your problem, for instance, might be releasing stored bodyfat. Or maybe you have a sluggish thyroid (thyroid hormones directly control your bodys metabolism).

Mixed thought on the mix by R. Todd Woodstock Comments: Used this in the past when trying to lose weight while incorporating a rigid workout. This product contains a lot of nutrients, which were great for my body, but I really never noticed weight loss from this product. I do like that it contained essential aminos for my type of workout regimen; however, that was the only thing that impressed me. Recommended only for the avid physically fit person.

I only tried one bottle. Lots of pills to take, two packs a day for 21 days.
