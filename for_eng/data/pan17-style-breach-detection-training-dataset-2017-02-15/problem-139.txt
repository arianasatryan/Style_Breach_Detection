The Nissan Titan was introduced in 2004, as Nissan's entry into the full-sized pickup truck market. The driving experience with the Titan is uniformly good due to its power, towing ability and ride. Most drivers stated they could live with the gas mileage as a tradeoff for the better performance. The 2008 model will come with optional longer truck bed lengths and with a larger optional gas tank. The Titan will continue to be Nissan's truck entry for the next couple of years at least.

It was designed to be an alternative choice to the big Detroit trucks. The Titan comes in a 2-door or 4-door version and is powered by a V8 engine. The roomy interior is welcome and even more so when the buyer moves from a crew cab version to a king cab version. This model when first brought to market was praised for many of its standard features. The MPG rating is 12/17 city and highway.

Despite Nissan's best efforts, the Nissan Titan has usually been overlooked in the full-size truck field. While reviewers tend to find very little to dislike about the Titan, they find more to like in trucks from Chevy, Ford and Toyota. The Titan debuted in the U.S. in 2004 and shares a platform with large Nissan and Infiniti SUVs, including the Armada and QX56. The Nissan Titan is best known for its handsome styling, strong engines and versatile cargo capabilities. The Titan also offers some features not often found in the truck market, including four-wheel disc brakes and a factory spray-in bed liner. Unfortunately for it, the Titan is also known for its lackluster interior, which many reviewers say feels cheap.
